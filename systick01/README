Added a systick continuous timer to the virtual hardware.  Which takes
snapshots of a timer variable used in the simulation.  Reading from
address 0xD1000000 gets you a snapshot of this timer.

This example is for looking at waveforms with.  Run the sim and look
at the waveforms, if you look at the top level signals and zoom to
fit on your screen you will see the o_wb_we signal have a bunch
of relatively narrow spaced pulses, three lone ones and then 10
wider spaced.  If you look at the code there are some writes for the
stack when enterning notmain then the 10 writes to 0xE0000000 as fast
as the code will do it.  Then I print the timer count three times
to get a feel for how many ticks for that code.  Then go into a loop
that uses this timer tick to space out the writes to 0xE0000000, which
you can see is happening.
